# OSRS Streamers
up_A plugin used to identify in-game characters that are usually/currently streamed on Twitch._

## Features

### Highlighting streamers
Players who are registered as verified streamers by OSRS Streamers will have their character tile highlighted, as well as a short-hand display of what their Twitch URL is above their head.

### Showing stream status
If a verified streamer is being highlighted and the OSRS Streams 'Check if live' and 'User access token' is turned on and [configured correctly](https://rhoiyds.github.io/osrs-streamers), then the plugin will check if their stream is currently active. If the streamer is live, the character will be highlighted in the brilliant, iconic Twitch colors.

### Right click -> Open Stream
If a verified streamer is being highlighted and their Twitch stream is currently live, a 'Twitch [Player name]' option will be added the to right click menu, which will take you directly to their Twitch stream.

## Becoming a Verified Streamer
The process is short and simple. Fill out the following [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRW3-etHyTj1JaAwO1PoRbd_SQr1TulpEZMOo5cdYQxwt14A/viewform?usp=sf_link). A streamer can have multiple character (i.e Alfie's 10+ dead HCIM's) names associated with their Twitch stream, however for each character name a seperate link to a Twitch VOD of the player using this character needs to be supplied for verification purposes. You can edit your response if you ever need to add new character names for verification in the future. Please use the following format:

    Character name 1 (i.e WhiteCat213)
    (Link to video of streamer playing on WhiteCat213)

    Character name 2
    (Link to video of streamer playing on Character 2)
